Get comfortable with tools
This document helps you get up to speed with three tool families:

Command Line Interface (CLI) tools, organized around the bash shell and git for version control.
The R statistical programming environment.
The python programming language.
For each, you can go as deep as you need to feel comfortable:

Installing the software. This is the bare minimum to have the tools available.
A gentle introduction. This is typically an in-browser interactive which assumes no prior knowledge.
A deeper dive. These provide much more exposition and extend to advanced topics.
bash and git

Install

If you’re running Mac OS X, bash is what you have by default in Terminal. You should install homebrew. Then brew install git.
If you’re running Windows, you should install Git Bash.
If you’re running Linux, you run bash or know better, and can install git.
Gentle Introduction

If you haven’t used a command line interface like bash, try The Command Line Crash Course. Ignore the stuff about PowerShell.
If you haven't used git, Try Git will teach you the basics in 15 minutes, in your browser. For a little more explanation, check out Atlassian's Git Basics and other tutorials.

Bash Guide for Beginners
Pro Git
python

Install

You really want the Anaconda python distribution. Download and install as appropriate for your system.
Gentle Introduction

If you haven't used python, the in-browser interactive tutorials from Codecademy aren't bad. They take some time to go through; skip the projects if you want to just work through the syntax.

Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
This one starts out very basic but eventually includes some sophisticated general ideas about programming.
Learn Python the Hard Way
This is probably the most popular intro to python, with a very distinctive voice, from the same author as the Command Line Crash Course, above.
