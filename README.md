**Instructor:** [Amy Roberts](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/amy-roberts/6290)

**EiRs:** Tom Hunter & Corey Maher 


###Course Description

Foundational course in data science, including machine learning theory, case studies and real-world examples, introduction to various modeling techniques, and other tools to make predictions and decisions about data. Students will gain practical computational experience by running machine learning algorithms and learning how to choose the best and most representative data models to make predictions. Students will be using Python throughout this course.


### Completion Requirements

You can always reach out to Daniel by phone or email if you have any inquiries about enrollment, payments, graduation requirements or questions about how to get to know other students.  
General Assembly's Part-time courses are pass/fail programs.  We have certain requirements in order to be considered a graduate of our programs:
